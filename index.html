            Description:    Kimchi is a staple in Korean cuisine, consisting of fermented vegetables, typically napa cabbage or radish, seasoned with chili pepper, garlic, ginger, and salt.

It is often served as a side dish and is considered a key component of Korean meals, known for its health benefits due to probiotics.\
